Polymorphism Property 2 
Polymorphism is one of the most important property of the oops  .
The word "poly" means many and the word morphism mean  many ways to represent .
The word mean many ways to represent  . 

Lmaguage which does not support polyumorphism is reffred to as not a oops langauge . 
Those are called as the object pases langauges (ops) .

Polymorhpism always occueres at the time of inheritance . 
There are differernt type of polymorphism .  
one is the runtime 
other is the complie time polymorphism . 

Compile time or Static polymorphism -> this is done by method overloading  .
method ovberloading -> when a class have a multiple function with same name but the name , and the return type can be very different .  
The best example of this is the mutiple constructors / multiple functions .  
example -> A a = new A() ;
	A a = new A(_ some parameter) ;
this is called the complie time polymorphiasm under the sub branch of method ovberloading . 
The complier decides which contructor to call at the complie time that is why called the compile time polymorhpism . '

During the method overloading if the nane is samne thern the return type , number of input should be different . 
order of the type can also be different  ,
example  -> string a  , int b ;
example 2  - int a  , string b   ;
this above alawys works .  The complie time is also called the static polymorphsim  . 
When there is a double parameter need to be passed and the user passes a int then there is a auto casting of the double to int and the output is printed this is called as the casting  . this happend in flaot and int conversion  . 

Runtime or dynamic polymorhpism - >
The is acheived by method overriding  .Method overriding is important in this .
Considerinng a parent class with the parameter , name of the attributes and all the attribures are same even the name is same but body is different then this helps in the implementation of runtime - polymorphiism  .
