piping -> linux  -> Bash 
pipe in bash is a syntax that is use to run several command at once .
this can be done by for exmpale say sort-r | head - l the thing in the betwewen is the piping 
the -r use to rever the sort . 
using the for loop will help a lot in making a large computation . 
to get 10 sorrted files we use the following syntax 
for -> ls - i | sort | head -10  ;
list -1 is used to see the latest file sections  . 

file operations  -> reading and writing or doing both .
file reading  -> 
this is done with the help of file -r 
writing  -> this is done with the help of file redirection of the reader script to a file . 
to wrtit the output we can use this in the two methods  
./ reader .sh name.txt >output.txt
this above make the output of names.txt into the output.txt file . 
> cat / output.txt is used to see the file contents in the output.txg . this is command or we can say a synatx .

now the second method  ->
./reader name.txt >> output.txt 
this has two > sign this is same ot the first command but it does not ereases the content of the files ouptut it only add the output to the  bottom of the file. 

file checkusm  ->
the check sum is used to check the size of the given bash file .
adding or subtracing can chjanger the checksum values . 


 sleep  ->
sleep command makes the command sleep unitl they are needed . 
the delay command is used to make a delay in the file or in the command and this makes the file sleep for some timne .maybe a few seconds  .
using the ampersand at the last will show some of the addirtioanl information like the index , threadnumber etc  the process id and the thread execution .

taking the user input -> 
read - p "what is yout first name" NAME // the name or the word in the cap is called the variable and is used in the input . 
output is echo"yout name is $name" 

handling the bad data  -

- p is used to put the data on the same line of the use line . 
-z is used to chekc if the variable is empty or not . -z name of the container check if the conatiner ius empty or not . 
to check if a string is a alphebetics we use $name = ^[] + $ 
this is used to check if there is a interger in the string or not . 
to check the totoal alpohabets in the strign use - > a-z  in ther string   .
