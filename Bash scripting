Shell scripting commands
to make a file - > touch nameof thefile . extension  
bash has the extension of .bash or we can alos use a shell extension that is .sh 
to print somehting on the bash we use -> echo  "text "

to run a file use - > touch name with extension  > ide name for running  > bash . sh 
> output of the file  .

the name of the ide name of the .sh is the syntax used . 

to make a file executable we haev to change the mode of the file opening which can either be read , write  read + write  . 

chmod command is use top change the mode of the file > this gives everyone to read and execute the script for example 755 is used to do the same .

to execute the bash file use ./name of the file.sh  
adding the comment is important and this can beadded using the pound sign  this is used to add the coment in tyhe scripts  .

the coment is also used by the hash sign also so we can use the hash to execute the same ./ 
comment arer used as the echos 
for each user we have to define which part of the processor has to use the bash file command and the statement so we have to specify the same  .

/bin/bash are use to find the paths of the file and swee how the excutioj is taking place . 

to specify the envioroment 
we use  -> /user/bin/env java / javascript etc  .

variable decleration is same as that of other programming language 


.bash file 

first namme = blue 
lastname = cyan 
echo hi firstname is lastname ; 

execute the file  .
./~.bash file  

varibale has letter , numbre and underscroes  
the letter is again a character of 4 bits   .
they are case sensetive  .
they are uppcase  , but this is not mandaotry  .

this is $name , $syntax is the synatax used . 

Parameter   >
$0 > the name of the script , rthe paths is included  .
$1 > the first parameter  .
$2  > the second  parameter  
we cannot passed the dollar sign nine and after that the parameetr gets over . 
the final paramter is 
$255 the values is from $0 to $255 .
 
let the name of the file be ->param.sh 
./param.sh rohan 
output > hello rohan 
echo hello $1 

echo $(date)
echo $(name) both of this takes the paramter 

the value of 0 mean sucess in the bash shell something else display a error . 

if then conditionals - >
if conditional 
	then  result 
fi 

environment variables are defined by the user and they allow the user to set these according to the standard  .

touch var.sh  
chmod 755 var.sh 


example of the enviroment variable is $path . 
and similary there are several in built functions .


some of the environment variables 
home  -> user home directory  
path  -> directotoies which are searched for the commands  
hostname -> hostname of machines 
shell  -> shell thts is being used 
user - > user of this session  
term -> type of command line terminals that is bieng used 
thereare a lot of enviromental variables than defiend  

functions  -> they lets use do the duplicqting in the code  .
the way to create a function is the normal way to make a functions . 
the calling of a function is also very much smam to c , jaav , cpp .
funtion must be dedfined before the calling .

passing the paramter to a funtion :
usee a local variable to make or do the function calling . 
the pasing of the paramter to a function is same as the way it is pasing to a script  .
