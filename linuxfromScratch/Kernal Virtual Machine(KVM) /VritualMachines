Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based emulations of physical computers. 
They allow multiple operating systems and applications to run simultaneously on a single physical machine, known as the host machine.
Each VM operates independently of the others and has its own virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces.

Here are some key concepts related to virtual machines:

Emulation of Hardware: Virtual machines emulate the hardware components of a physical computer, including CPU, memory, storage devices 
(disk drives), and network interfaces. These virtual hardware components are created and managed by the hypervisor, the software layer responsible for virtualization.

Guest Operating Systems: Each virtual machine runs its own guest operating system, which can be different from the host operating system.
This allows users to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. Common guest operating systems include various versions 
of Windows, Linux, macOS, and others.

Isolation: Virtual machines provide isolation between different VMs running on the same host machine. 
Each VM operates in its own isolated environment, with its own set of resources and configurations, preventing one VM from affecting the operation of others.

Resource Allocation: The hypervisor allocates physical hardware resources, such as CPU cycles, memory, and storage, among the virtual 
machines running on the host machine. Resource allocation can be adjusted dynamically based on workload demands and priorities.

Virtual Machine Lifecycle: Virtual machines can be created, started, stopped, and deleted dynamically by the hypervisor.
Users can also save and restore the state of a virtual machine, allowing for easy backup, migration, and recovery.

Virtual machines are widely used in various computing environments for a variety of purposes, including:

Server virtualization: Consolidating multiple servers onto a single physical machine to improve resource utilization and reduce costs.
Desktop virtualization: Running multiple virtual desktops on a single physical workstation or server, enabling centralized management and deployment of desktop environments.
Development and testing: Creating isolated development and testing environments for software development, testing, and debugging.
Cloud computing: Provisioning and managing virtual machines in cloud environments to deliver scalable and flexible computing resources on-demand.
