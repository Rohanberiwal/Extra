HyperVisor 

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software layer that enables multiple virtual machines (VMs)
to run on a single physical machine. The hypervisor abstracts the physical hardware resources of the host machine and allocates them
to the virtual machines, allowing each VM to operate independently as if it were running on its own dedicated hardware.

There are two primary types of hypervisors:

Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal): A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware of the host machine, without the
need for an underlying operating system. It has direct access to the hardware resources and manages them to create and control the VMs.
Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted): A Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system, known as the host operating system. 
It relies on the host OS to manage hardware resources and provides virtualization capabilities through software emulation.
Type 2 hypervisors are typically used for desktop virtualization or development/testing environments. Examples include VMware Workstation, 
Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop.

Key functions of a hypervisor include:

Resource Management: The hypervisor manages the allocation of physical hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces,
among the virtual machines running on the host machine.

Isolation: The hypervisor ensures that each virtual machine operates in isolation from other VMs, preventing one VM from interfering with
the operation of others. Isolation improves security and stability in multi-tenant environments.

Virtual Machine Lifecycle Management: The hypervisor controls the creation, start-up, shutdown, and deletion of virtual machines, 
as well as the migration of VMs between physical hosts.

Performance Optimization: The hypervisor optimizes resource utilization and performance by dynamically adjusting resource allocation 
based on workload demands and priorities.

Hypervisors play a crucial role in server virtualization, cloud computing, and desktop virtualization environments,
enabling organizations to consolidate hardware resources, improve flexibility and scalability, and reduce costs.
