Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) 
It is a virtualization technology that allows the Linux kernel to function as a hypervisor, enabling it to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) 
simultaneously on a single physical machine.
Some of the information on the KVM IS :

Kernel-Based: KVM is integrated directly into the Linux kernel, meaning it is part of the operating system's core functionality.
This integration allows KVM to leverage the kernel's capabilities for process scheduling, memory management, and hardware device access, resulting in high performance and efficiency.
Virtual Machine: A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a physical computer system that runs on a host machine.
Each VM has its own virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces, allowing it to run its own operating system and applications independently of other VMs.
Hypervisor: KVM acts as a hypervisor, which is a layer of software that enables multiple VMs to share the physical hardware resources of a host machine.
The hypervisor manages the allocation of CPU, memory, and other resources among the VMs, ensuring fair and efficient utilization of hardware resources.
Hardware Virtualization Support: KVM relies on hardware virtualization extensions such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V to improve performance and efficiency. 
These extensions allow guest VMs to run directly on the CPU without the need for software emulation, resulting in near-native performance for virtualized workloads.
Use of Virtualization Technology: Virtualization technology, including KVM, has several uses and benefits:
Server Consolidation: Virtualization allows multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical server, reducing hardware costs and improving resource utilization.
Isolation and Security: Virtualization provides isolation between VMs, preventing one VM from impacting the stability or security of others. 
This isolation helps improve security and stability in multi-tenant environments.
Development and Testing: Virtualization enables developers to create and test software in isolated environments without affecting their production systems.
Disaster Recovery: Virtualization facilitates the creation of backup copies of virtual machines, making it easier to recover from hardware failures or disasters.
Overall, KVM is a powerful virtualization technology that leverages the capabilities of the Linux kernel to provide efficient and 
scalable virtualization solutions for a wide range of use cases, from server consolidation to development and testing.
