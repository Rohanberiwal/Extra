A tarball is a compressed archive file format commonly used in Unix-like operating systems.
It is created using the tar command, which stands for "tape archive." 
The tar command combines multiple files and directories into a single archive file, preserving their directory structure and file permissions.
The term "tarball" typically refers to a tar archive file that has been compressed using a compression algorithm such as gzip (tar.gz) or 
bzip2 (tar.bz2). This compression reduces the file size of the archive, making it more efficient to store and transfer over networks.
Tarballs are often used for distributing software packages, as they allow developers to bundle multiple files and 
directories into a single compressed file. Users can then extract the contents of the tarball on their system using the tar command,
restoring the original files and directory structure.

Structure: A tarball is essentially an archive file that combines multiple files and directories into a single file.
It preserves the directory structure and file permissions of the original files and directories.

Compression: Tarballs are often compressed using compression algorithms like gzip (tar.gz) or bzip2 (tar.bz2). 
This compression reduces the overall size of the archive, making it more efficient to store and transfer over networks.

Creation: Tarballs are created using the tar command in Unix-like operating systems. For example, to create a tarball named
archive.tar.gz containing the contents of a directory named my_directory, you would use the following command:
Copy code
tar -czf archive.tar.gz my_directory
Extraction: To extract the contents of a tarball, you can use the tar command with the appropriate options. 
For example, to extract the contents of archive.tar.gz, you would use the following command:
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
