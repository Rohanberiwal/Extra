OPERATING System  :
every iot device has a os . 
os allows to do more comoplex comuputations 
to run  a program wihtout a os we have to use the concept of a super loop techinque .
one file with the testing one that is running fir the infinte time and the other that is checking the error in the file . using the file that is running . 

In between the interupts helps in the taking of the component tasking , input taking  .
the problem with the super loop is that the things get out of control very easiy also therre has to be the interupts and the task scehduling that  again and again for the exectuion of the program 

for the iot devices  :
resource management 
protability 
modularity 
power efficient 
extensibility 
modularity and supprot , liscensing 
these are the major requirements 

os for resouce contrained devices 
the resouce contained devices is a embedded deveice and is very different from the other devics
they have a limited storage units  .
