Shell scripting and processe in the cpu 
Shell check if the commnad is in built or not
Shell then check if the command is a alias of the other commnnd or not 
Shell then looks if the commnad is tn the disk 
> it searches fir the commnad in the path and if not found then gives thee errr .

zsh is the most powerful shell  .


terminal vs shell 
terminal is the window that we type into and nothing else 
shell is the interper that convert the twext to the binary language . 

xfce terminal has a tooolbar andf the gnome does not have one .

cd ..akes to the parent directory that is one level up
the . notation is givne by the file systems  and helps the user to view th files  .
cd - take to the directory one dwon  means to the child  . this shows the path directly .
The file cannot be copied using the hypen and this is the feautre of just the viewing the paths and the file name .

cd is a shell function  .
cd . -> file system
cd .. -> file location  
cd - > argument to cd commands
cd ~ -> function of the bash shell. Takes the user to the home directory   .

cd - expands to the $OLDPWD 
dirs use to point to the top of the stack  .
pop d to remove the top of the command  .
using the tab can do the auto completion of the path for the user . 
using the tab twice can open the same with the name of the possible files on the desktop  .
up and down arrow use to see the previous commands  .
history on the shell will show the previous commands  .

re - run the commnand using the !* .
!! -> this appends to the entire previous line . 
HISTCONTROL -> NAME OF THE COMMAND TO CIONTROL . 
using the man strftime caan be use to view the commnadsd that can be used to format the fisplay of the pevious histroy commnads .

in the shell there are mainly 2 variables : 
enviromental -> those defined for the currrent shell and are inherirted by the child shell or the processes . 



shell variables -> they are contianed on in the shell they are defined and cannot be ascessed  by any other shell or the process . 

to see the enviroment of the sehll we use -> echo $SHELL .
run shell script is called the non - interacrtive non login shell system  .

to execute the commnad on the shell use -> /etc/profile.d/*.sh command 
to add the function use /etc/bashrc 

~/.bashrc -> uses alias and the shell function  .
/etc/bashrc > system alias and function . 

File globbing >
expands a file name containing wildcards character in the specific file name . 

A file matches the following 
file.txt 
file.jpg
file.tar.gz 
this matches nothing or anything in the middle  .
the asterick is not only the only gliob there is someghting callled the ? which is used to match the characters 
the questioon marks is always more strict then the astericks .

using the synatx called the file?.txt
the kernal match the file1.txt and filea.txrt with the same  .
in this the number of character matches the number of the character and using the fixed number would help the use to identify the same  .
to match a combination of files use the smiple formula called this 
file[-0-9].txt
this output all the files from the 0->9 and hence the output is from 0->9 .txt .

use the man 7 glob to get more help  .

the asterick after a range match the whole rangees and do n*m computataion to do and match the proper combination .
